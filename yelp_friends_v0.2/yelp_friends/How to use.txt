How to use

4. install MySQL-Python using installer (in Libraries folder)

5. run test.py to check mysql is installed well
6. write first user id(SEED_ID) at main.py, and run it.

ALGORITHM
1. Parse SEED's data and save it to database
2. Parse SEED's friends and save user data simply
   (only yelpid, name, and location. other information like friend_num is '-1')
3. choose someone from "simply saved user list"
4. and set that person to new SEED
5. go to 1.

6. if error detected, stop parsing
7. and load data from database it to text file.
