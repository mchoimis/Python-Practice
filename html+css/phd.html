                        <u>Beware: This essay is a rough manuscript, still being worked on.</u> During the admission season, I was asked by some applicants about the doctoral program. I guess I an not a right person to talk about PhD at the moment <strong>yet</strong>, but I wanted to have something written down before I forgot -- which I never finished. It was because I felt so humbled and wanted to wait until I would have a better grasp of what a PhD is. It's been only a little more than a year at the time of writing so I may have different thoughts by the time I finish coursework, go to conferences, complete comprehensive exam, etc. Thus, here we are, in a very preliminary version which was intended to serve as motivation to others as well as self-motivation. Although it's not a finished work, I still open it, and will try to update it as I get closer to important milestones. If you do need advice at hand, I recommend <a href='http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm' target='_blank'>Philip Guo</a> (U of Rochester CS Prof), <a href='http://faculty.som.yale.edu/jameschoi/teaching.html' target='_blank'>James Choi</a> (Yale Biz/Econ Prof), <a href='http://seanjtaylor.com/post/69207650501/faq' target='_blank'>Sean Talyor</a> (NYU IS PhD, now at Facebook), and many exemplary sources on the web. They help me a lot, too. &#9632;

                		I think many students enter doctoral program without thinking much about what a PhD is. By PhD, it would mean either of the following:
                	</p>
                	
                	<p>
                		1. Doctor of Philosophy, the highest degree conferred in an advanced institution<br/>
                		2. a doctor of philosophy, a person who has completed doctorate and obtained the degree as proof of the completion of requirement<br/>
                		3. a course of study, which usually includes coursework (in the US system) and thesis defense, which used to take up to 12 years in medieval Europe <br/>
                		4. According to street definition: <a href='http://phdcomics.com/comics.php'>Piled Higher and Deeper</a>, <a href='/quote.html' target='_blank'>Permanent Head Damage</a>, etc. ... <br/>
                	</p>

                		As cheesy as it sounds, doing PhD is by no means easy. Not only because of difficulty but also due to personal fit with doctoral study, some people end up not finishing and go on a different route. Many current students may still ask themselves whether they are good or bad, or if this is a "right" way or not. I think all this agony is in part attributed to the lack of recognition beforehand as to what doing a PhD would be like. I do not mean everyone should stay in the grad school once they made up their mind. As long as they're happy after they decide on other professions, it's good. I see many of my colleagues seek alternative values in cultivating their own lives after they leave. Does this mean that current students are by nature a better fit with academia? Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes even remaining ones have to adjust themselves to what they consider more desirable in the academic field. In either case, I believe it would've been much easier if people had known a bit more about going to graduate school.

                		I think I myself was not an exception. I just said that this may have resulted from the general lack of recognition. To be precise, I think there are some false indications of what a PhD is about that people came to adopt. Thus, our (yes, our) problem was superficial or even incorrect understanding of it, not the lack thereof per se. We needed a more <strong>realisitic</strong> sense.

                        It does not imply that we could've pictured more correctly if we had had better information. No. This is not an individual fault. Nobody can gague the level of depth until s/he actually gets into the ocean. Because you are an accumulation of your experiences (Wittgenstein?), this is a fairly justifiable statement. You and I are not to blame, to some degree at least. As I progress toward the end of a second year, I become more certain that only those who adapt themselves can survive.

                        How can mere 4 to 6 years of doctoral study change or even shape our personality? What is PhD? I have provided three (to four) defitnions I can think of on top of my head. I have to say I still do not have the fullest comprehension of what a PhD is, to be honest. Nonetheless, it seems to be that none of the above captures the gist.
