                        I was born as a much celebrated honeymoon baby. I recall I began learning English at 4 or 5 from my mom who was teaching at a high school. Shortly after that, I got formal education from native teachers in Canada.

                        A funny story. As a pre-school kid, I found upper case alphabets visually prettier than lower cases. Once, I wrote down Michael Jackson's lyrics all in capital letters. I kept doing it until I knew it was not commonly acceptable. Of course, I didn't do so when I typed command lines in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC' title='GW-Basic'>GW-Basic</a>. It was my first programming language as well as first computer experience (1991). This early exposure to coding helped me later learn languages like C.

                        I started building my own homepage with HTML and CGI boards at Junior High. When the concept of email was still new, I knew how to exchange messages with other teenage friends overseas. My first webmail account was at Yahoo! and favorite portal was AltaVista. To me, it seemed to be the most innovative company. (AltaVista's babelfish was the earliest real-time web translation engine, inspring Google Translate we know now.) </p><p>

                    <p> 
                        Then I entered a strict private boarding school near Seoul in 2000. Computer access was limited. But soon I became an avid user of an early generation online social network, which was Korea's no. 1, Alexa's no. 3 website. In fact, back in 2000, three out of top 10 sites in the world were Korean. I'm still impressed by the burst of web phenomena I came to observe in a country where the Internet usage was <a href='http://services.intead.com/blog/bid/302723/Understanding-Digital-Social-Media-in-South-Korea' title='Internet usage'>world record high</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        During this time, I dreamed of a fiction writer. I even had manuscripts. Given the percentile of <a href='http://monitor.icef.com/2014/01/high-performance-high-pressure-in-south-koreas-education-system/' title='it is within the 800th rank'>99.9%</a> in College SAT, however, I realized doing a degree would be a better bet than becoming a novelist. I went to Seoul National.

                        <p>On campus, I played guitar in school bands. I developed an online community for the university. I was an editor for a student publication. Off campus, I taught English to underprivileged kids. I interned at three IT companies. I traveled eight countries as a backpacker. By the time I graduated, I got an offer from Samsung. However, while I did "research" for a Bachelor's thesis (which later got <a href='http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oR2e6fwAAAAJ' title='Minjung Choi Google Scholar' target='_blank'>published</a> in an SSCI journal), I became more geared towards the management and organization disciplines. This experience led me to academia.

                		After the busy-enjoying-life period, I joined Intelligent Data Semantics Lab in a final year of undergrad. My training during Master's was mostly in data modeling and semantic data mining. I took doctoral-level classes and research seminars there, and wrote <a href='http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oR2e6fwAAAAJ' title='Minjung Choi Google Scholar' target='_blank'>six papers and one book chapter</a>. 
                	</p> 
                    <p>
                        Looking back, I came to believe that important moments do coincide. My parents were flexible about schooling so I received international education from early - and I could keep communicating with the friends abroad, thanks to the Internet. Growing up, the ups and downs of the web piqued my interest - and I finally got to study them, in a more serious manner. It was never planned that I went on to grad school - and now I am in a doctoral program, devoted to research. These chains of memories are still the driving forces that take me forward.
