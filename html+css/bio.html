                	<p> <u> Beware: It's a non-academic, rather lengthy-for-your-precious-time biography. </u>
                	</p>
                	
                	<p> Welcome. I am Minjung. I'm a doctoral student at Temple's Fox MIS program. 
                	</p> 

                	<p> 
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I was a good student (believe it or not) in a Master's program at <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=Seoul+National+University'>Seoul National University</a> (2009-2011).
                		During that time, I was an editor for university student press and voluntary English teacher for the underrepresented kids outside the campus.
                		Of course, I did more "exciting" things such as writing six papers and one book chapter, and taking doctoral-level classes and research seminars. 
                	</p> 

                	<p> 
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I was a not-so-good undergrad student at the same university, where I had not realized I'd pursue another degree later on.
                		During that time, I <a href='/pics.html' target='_blank'>played guitar</a> for an amateur band, performed in a drama club, and traveled around the world as a backpacker.
                		Of course, I did more "exciting" projects such as working as intern, and building an online community for the university. 
                	</p>

                	<p>
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I was an exchange student in <a href='http://www.hec.edu'>HEC Paris</a> (2007-2008), France's most prestigious <i>grande ecole </i> specializing in business studies.
                		During that time, I enjoyed a wide variety of wine and cheese, making the best use of cultural accomplishment of the country.
                		Of course, I tried to let others enjoy my own accomplishment, too, presenting at a city-sponsored business competition as a final runner-up.
                	</p>

                	<p> 
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I dreamed of studying literature in college or being a fiction writer.
                		During that time, I occasionally entertained my friends as an aspring story teller. 
                		Of course, my stories continuted until we finished the national college entrance exam. Given the percentile of <a href='http://monitor.icef.com/2014/01/high-performance-high-pressure-in-south-koreas-education-system/'>99.9%</a>, I realized going to college would be a better bet for me than becoming a good writer.
                	</p>

                	<p> 
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I attended, no, actually lived at a private boarding school for almost three years (2000-2003).
                		During that time, I was an avid user of <a href='http://services.intead.com/blog/bid/302723/Understanding-Digital-Social-Media-in-South-Korea'>an online social network</a> that used to be Korea's no. 1, Alexa's no. 3 website. It literally connected me and the outside world. 
                		Of course, I'm thankful that I could directly observe the burst of networking phenomena in a country where the Internet usage was <a href='http://services.intead.com/blog/bid/302723/Understanding-Digital-Social-Media-in-South-Korea'>record high</a>.
                	</p>

                	<p> 
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I started building my homepage with simple HTML and exchanging emails with friends from all over the world at junior high (1997-2000). 
                		During that time, I created my first email account at Yahoo! while my favorite search engine was AltaVista.
                		Of course, I vividly remember those endless nights that greeted me with modem beeps and <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=Telnet'>Telnet's black screen</a>.  
                	</p>

                	<p> 
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I recall I began learning English as a kid from my mother who was teaching at high school (late 1980's-early 1990's).
                		During that time, I somehow thought upper case alphabets are prettier than the lower case counterparts -- for that reason, I once wrote down Michael Jackson's lyrics in all capital letters.
                		Of course, I didn't do it when I began coding in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC'>GW-BASIC</a>, my first programming language. (If you remember numbering command lines and "Run" escaper, we have a lot more to say.)
                	</p>

                	<p> 
                		<strong>Before that</strong>, I was born as a much celebrated honeymoon <a href='/pics.html#Infant' target='_blank'>baby</a>.
                		During that time, my father's side of grandfather made a name for this new born while my mother's side relatives sent a person to get advice from a fortune teller. Coincidentally, and still to my surprise, both sides came up with the same name, Minjung.
                		Of course, I appreciate what my name's supposed to mean: eternal strength.
