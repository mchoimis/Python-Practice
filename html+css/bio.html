                        I was born as a much celebrated honeymoon baby. I recall I began learning English at 4 or 5 from my mom who was teaching at a high school. Shortly after that, I got formal education from native teachers in Canada.

                        A funny story. As a pre-school kid, I found upper case alphabets visually prettier than lower cases. Once, I wrote down Michael Jackson's lyrics all in capital letters. I kept doing it until I knew it was not commonly acceptable. Of course, I didn't do so when I typed command lines in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC' title='GW-Basic' rel='nofollow'>GW-Basic</a>. It was my first programming language as well as first computer experience (1991). This early exposure to coding helped me learn languages like C.

                        At Junior High, I started building my own homepage with HTML and CGI boards. It was endless modem beeps and black Telnet screen that greeted me every night. Then I entered a private boarding school near Seoul in 2000. Computer access was limited there. But soon I became an avid user of an early generation online social network, which was Korea's no. 1, Alexa's no. 3 website. In fact, back in 2000, three out of top 10 sites in the world were Korean. I'm still impressed by the burst of web phenomena I came to observe in that country where the Internet usage was <a href='http://services.intead.com/blog/bid/302723/Understanding-Digital-Social-Media-in-South-Korea' title='Internet usage' rel='nofollow'>world record high</a>.

                        As a teenager, I dreamed of a fiction writer. I even had manuscripts. But given the percentile of <a href='http://monitor.icef.com/2014/01/high-performance-high-pressure-in-south-koreas-education-system/' rel='nofollow'>99.9%</a> in College SAT (thankfully!), I realized doing a degree would be a better bet than becoming a good novelist. I went to Seoul National.

                        On campus, I played guitar in school bands. I developed and administered an online community for the university. I was an editor for a student publication. Off campus, I taught English to underprivileged kids. I interned at three IT companies. By the time I graduated, I got an offer from Samsung (again, thankfully). However, as I did "research" for a Bachelor's thesis (this case study later got <a href='http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oR2e6fwAAAAJ' title='Minjung Choi Google Scholar' target='_blank'>published</a> in an SSCI journal), I became more geared toward the management disciplines. One thing led to another, I entered into academia.

                		I joined Intelligent Data Semantics Lab in a final year of undergrad. My training during Master's was mostly in design science, especially data modeling (ER, UML, RDB/SQL), knowledge modeling (RDF, OWL, Prolog), and semantic data mining. I took doctoral-level classes and IS research seminars there, and wrote <a href='http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oR2e6fwAAAAJ' title='Minjung Choi Google Scholar' target='_blank'>six papers and one book chapter</a>. 
                	</p>

                        Looking back, it comes natural to me that important moments do coincide. Thanks to my parents flexible about schooling I received international education from early - and I could keep communicating with the friends abroad, through the Internet. Growing up, the ups and downs of the web piqued my interest - and I finally got to study about them, in a more serious manner. It was never planned that I went on to grad school - and now I am in a doctoral program, devoted to researching what lies beneath. These chains of memories are still the driving forces that take me forward.
