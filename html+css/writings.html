                        My main goal of writing in a non-journal outlet has been to communicate IS research in plain language. I also hope to contribute to the discussions on the standing of business schools and MIS. Below are some initial efforts (summaries are provided for you). Additionally, I post reflections on PhD life <a href='/writings1.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.

                        I wrote two introductory notes on behalf of Seoul National University's MIS Department. They are about the MIS discipline and braod IS research agenda respectively. The writings appeared on the Department homepage specifically designed to recruit prospective graduate students.

                        Upon submitting a paper about semantic search, I wanted to introduce some piece of it to business audience. In the essay, I introduce the relational properties of search queries. I evaluate a newly introduced semantic search feature of two existing text-based search engines. I suggest constructing "concurrent" concept topologies in a given database to enhance search performance. The constructon of ontologies in response to incoming news texts (corpora) will increase the relevance of the results.<br>This essay was written in early 2011 and now Twitter adopts a similar idea to reflect real-time trends in search.<br>

                        As a student with two degrees in Business Administration, I talk about the common but somewhat misled expectations imposed on business schools, business research institutions, and professional business education. My experiences at business schools during undergraduate and master (and now doctorate) totally differed one another -- but this is not well understood by many important populations. In the essay, I address the constrasting views on a business research school.<br>

                        Upon completing my Master's thesis, I wanted to introduce my research areas in plain language with real-world examples. This essay is a first effort. I explain the concept of computational ontology used to parse and process unstructured information in IBM Watson. Watson is a question-and-answering machine developed by IBM which communicates in natural langauge. It (or he) shows outstanding performance in an American quiz betting show Jeopardy! and wins the Finals beating two other human contestants. I discuss why the machine didn't bet a larger amount in the final answer but why it was an accurate judgment from an artificial intelligence (AI) point of view.<br>
